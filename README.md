# Grammatical-encoding-in-Language-production
This study asks whether verb planning is primarily determined by linear word order or by the strength of argument dependencies. It is predicted that argument explicitness will play the stronger role, such that overt, marked arguments trigger earlier verb retrieval than clitic or null arguments, even when verbs appear in different linear positions.
