Have you ever started a sentence like “That movie we watched last night…” and then paused not because you forgot the next word, but because you were deciding how to continue? You might finish the sentence in different ways: “…was directed by Tarantino,” “…had the most unexpected ending,” “…made me want to read the book. You already knew the subject, but the sentence could not move forward until you had chosen the main action. This hesitation illustrates a central question in psycholinguistics: how far ahead sentence planning extends before articulation, and when verbs are accessed within this process.
